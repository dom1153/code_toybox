[0:43] RETRY (echo)

[1:14] > "The number you have dialled is not available at present. Please leave your message after the beep."

[1:24] Even in my solitude, I come to realise
[1:36] My soliloquy that flowed through the telephone line
[1:47] It's because of my solitude that I keep searching
[1:57] For you to come and answer my phone call.

[2:33] RETRY (echo)

[2:53] One way or another, I want it to be heard by just you:
[3:04] My soliloquy that flowed through the telephone line

[3:09] > "The number you have dialled is not available at present. Please leave your message after the beep."

[3:15] You're like that, as well, holding scissors
Within a crowd of people, you're holding scissors
Made blunt through absent-mindedness, the blades chime
Before anyone realises, the blades are rusting together

Even that pain from the wound where my finger was cut:
Before anyone realises, we're already forgetting all about it
Sewing together scissors that remain closed,
You had noticed my hand:
Hearing your sobbing voice, I remember.

[3:40] It seeps through the phone call I'd come to believe in:
The colour of an X
The scissors had been rusted shut
So here, swallow the needle.
Cry and repent

[3:52] 3 & 2 & 151,
A BROKEN HEART,
A SUPREME INFERIORITY COMPLEX

[3:56] It's just that you resent
Li'l ol' me.

[4:24] Beyond the cut-off phone call, I arrange
Funerary lilies
Frame and display, That loneliness you'd chosen.
I want you to laugh at me

[4:35] 3 & 2 & 151
A BROKEN HEART,
AN UNCHANGED SILENCE

[4:41] It's just, I believe
In the static

[4:47] My fingertip I'd managed to lightly cut bleeds
The colour of an X, and it blurs your eyes
I want to see them reflected In these sharpened scissors.

[4:57] 3 & 2 & 151
A DAMAGED HEART,
AN ETERNAL CRAWLING SENSATION

[5:06] But still, I believe
In the light that's restored.
