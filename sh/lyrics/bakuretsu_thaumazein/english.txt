Digital generation from a world in mutation
Everyone is looking for answers

The high energy skyscraper
Lights a fire in withered hearts

Heartbeats recorded as waveforms
Will bring color to this monochrome world

High voltage at my fingertips
The space curves are heating up

--

Innocent and naive Berserker! (Yeah!!)
Run in a straight line Go Go Go Go!!

Boring and ordinary Parkour (Yeah!!)
Shout it out now: Denonbu!

--

Looking down from above, a shadow
Is reshaping the landscape to call forth a new world

Break out of the labyrinth
The code we followed will lead us to the truth

One, Two, Three, Go!

Neon-induced Thaumazein
Flames of hope are flickering to life

Balsam nurtured by solitude
Watered by a chance encounter, the flowers bloom

Unexpected future encounters
Will take back the true colors

A wish able to change your waveform
The space curve binds us all

Ready for battle, Survival! (Yeah!!)
Pierce it with the Spitfire Bang Bang Bang Bang!!

Open an hole! Background world! (Yeah!!)
This is what you craved for: Denonbu!

The shadow falls into pieces
Its remains infusing the new world

Put your envy in your notes
Let the door that was brought down be our path to the truth
